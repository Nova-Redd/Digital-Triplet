Since the Thermal Process Control NX CAD Design has more than 100 parts, it cannot be shared here. We have provided a google drive link which will give you access to the folder
with all the designed parts, assemblies and drawing files. Go to the google drive link file and use the link to access the complete folder. There are pdf files provided so that 
you can download and view the labelled NX CAD design and the wiring diagram.
