This folder contains the TIA Portal project that contains the PLC program that was used to automate the machine and also create a virtual simulation of the processes on the
CAD Simulation Assembly. The program was written in TIA Potal version 16 (V16). We converted the programs to pdf form so that it is visible to those who dont have the TIA 
Portal program.
