# Task
Its 2020 and the world is in the fourth insustrial revolution!
Engineering Cyber-Physical systems are evolving from Digital Twin models to Digital Triplet.
At Dedan Kimathi University of Technology (DeKUT) SIEMENS Mechatronics Systems training centre, we are tasked to add Face-Recogniton security access and Voice assistants to the Digital Twin models of the Analytic and Thermal Process Control stations.
This repository outlines the approaches we took to achieve this

# Analytic and Thermal Process Control stations

Both of these stations are developed by Amatrol to teach and train on process control which is a vital part of major industries, including: power generation; petrochemicals; food processing and bottling; chemical manufacturing; biotechnology; pharmaceuticals and refineries.

The Analytic process control station monitors and regulates the pH of a process fluid. The station runs on PID Controller Module â€“ Single Loop (T5554-C1-A) or PID Controller Module â€“ Dual Loop (T5554-C2-A)

The Thermal process control station, on the other hand, regulates temperature. The controller for this station is PID Controller Module â€“ Dual Loop (T5553-C2-A).

In 2018, the team of Isaiah Nassiuma, Emanuel Sunguti, Langat KIpkoech Rogers and Timothy Kimari proposed a new control method based on the Siemens S7 1200 PLC PID control functionality.

In 2020, the controller used for both stations was the Siemens S7 1200 PLC (CPU 1214C DC/DC/DC)

# Criteria
1. Digital Twin models for the stations
2. Real time Face recognition
3. Intelligent voice assistant
4. Real time mask detection to ensure the operator always wears his mask correctly

# Tech Stack Summary
We used Siemens NX software to build the digital twin models. With the software, we could design and simulate realizing the best from the digital twins

PLC programs were written in the TIA portal(Totally Integrated Automation)

Face recognition, voice assistant and mask detection programmes were written in Python. We chose Python due to its popularity in Artificial intelligence implementation. our face and voice recognition models had to be intelligent. Secondly, and full disclosure I believe this is one of the major reasons, we didnt have a lot of experience programming. Python has a very huge community, which is only growing, and growingðŸ˜Š since the introduction of deep learning. We joined the community and keep learining so much! From basic programming, through machine-learning and deep learning fundamentals to deep learning APIs (Keras and a bit of Pytorch)

The mask detection model was created in Tensorflow Keras API

Communication between client machine and server computer was done through OPC UA protocol(Open Platform Communications Unified Architecture)

The Snap7 library was used to interface Python programs with the S7 1200 PLC

# Breakdown of approaches taken
The following section is a breakdown of the directories at the top of this repository
## Face-recognition
We did face recognition in two ways;
1. Using Python's face-recognition library 
2. Through transfer learning  
  
I will describe our experiences with both outlining the challenges faced, ways we went around them and possible solutions for those that we didn't
### Using Python's face-recognition library
This was the easiest and most accurate. And why not, its basically recognition through comparison. Locate a face from the camera feed, compare it with saved images, and boom! Match found! or no boomðŸ˜¶if unauthorized
#### Challenges
Every authorized user has a folder with their image. When the program runs, it processes all the images in all the folders, opens the camera and compares the face from the feed with the known faces trying to find a match.  
As the number of authorized users increases, so does the number of images to be processed. This means more processing time and it becomes increasingly difficult for the program to work in real time.
#### Solution
Use a face cascade classifier from open-cv to extract faces from images of known users. Use these extracted faces as reference images since they are smaller in size than selfies and full size images. A smaller image means shorter processing times  
If the program still has challenges working in real time, switch it up, elevate, and use deep learning models like a pro!ðŸ˜Ž

### Through transfer learning
This is possibly the most powerful way to do face-recognition and other image classification tasks eg mask detection. It involves using pre-trained deep learning models and 'transfering' the knowledge learned on those tasks to similar tasks. Deep learning models can work in realtime even with increased number of authorized users. However, their accuracy is dependent on how well the models learns to generalize during training.  
We transfer-learned Google's MobileNet and ResNet50 a variant of ResNet model
#### MobileNet
MobileNets are a class of light weight deep convolutional neural networks for mobile and embedded vision applications. They can run on mobile devices due to their small sixe. the size of the largest MobileNet currently is about 17 MB. Comparatively, VGG16, a model used in computer vision tasks is 533 MB.  

MobileNets are trained on the ImageNet dataset. The MobileNet in the Keras functional models has 1000 classifications. When we retrained the model to our custom dataset, we changed the classification layers to 4 nodes, each representing an authorized user. We also retrained some of the hidden layers. The only layers we didnt retrain were the top bottleneck layers used for feature extraction.  

The code at the top of this repo has comments to help you follow along. If you would like a detailed tutorial on how to work with MobileNet in Keras, please check out Deeplizard's Keras series. They have both video and text based resources. Tutorials 17 through 19 are on MobileNets. We learnt a lot from them.(Thankyou so much! Mandy and ChrisðŸ˜€)

##### Challenges
These are more of useful insights but can easily challenge how the model learns if not observed.
1. Balanced number of images- sounds pretty obvious right? Have the same number of images for each member(whether in the training set or validatuon set). First time retraining the model, I didnt think  there would be much difference with using 150 images(which are certainly not enough) for one user and 100 for another. But yes, there was. The model would give better predictions on the first user and perform comparatively worse on the other.

2. Variations and number of images- Augment your images. Flip horizontally, rotate, zoom,crop; these variations in the training and validation set help a model to generalize better. There is a program on data augmentation in Keras at the top of this repo. If you don't have access to more images, you can specify the number of images to generate from each image. 

3. Number of hidden layers to retrain- As mentioned earlier, we freeze the top layers, retrain classification and some hidden layers. Experiment with this number(hidden layers). Find the optimum number for your dataset.

4. GPU training- As you may have realized, training for the optimum weights is through trial and error. You end up training your model a number of times before it gives accurate predictions. This training process takes very long on the CPU. If you dont have access to a machine with a NVIDIA GPU, run your code on Google Colab and utilize the GPUs at Google. 

#### Resnet50
ResNet50 is a variant of ResNet model which has 48 Convolution layers along with 1 MaxPool and 1 Average Pool layer. It has 3.8 x 10^9 Floating points operations. It is a widely used ResNet model. Because of the framework that ResNets presented it was made possible to train ultra deep neural networks and by that I mean that the network can contain hundreds or thousands of layers and still achieve great performance.The ResNets were initially applied to the image recognition task but the framework can also be used for non computer vision tasks also to achieve better accuracy. 

##### Challenges
As we know that Deep Convolutional neural networks are really great at identifying low, mid and high level features from the images and stacking more layers generally gives us better accuracy so a question arrises that is getting better model performance as easy as stacking more layers? With this questions arises the problem of vanishing/exploding gradients. These problems were largely handled by many ways and enabled networks with tens of layers to converge but when deep neural networks start to converge we see another problem of the accuracy getting saturated and then degrading rapidly and this was not caused by overfitting as one may guess and adding more layers to a suitable deep model just increased the training error.

##### Solution
This problem was further rectifed by by taking a shallower model and a deep model that was constructed with the layers from the shallow model and and adding identity layers to it and accordingly the deeper model shouldn't have produced any higher training error than its counterpart as the added layers were just the identity layers.

In the Figure above we can see on the left and the right that the deeper model is always producing more error, where in fact it shouldn't have done that.The authors addressed this problem by introducing deep residual learning framework so for this they introduce shortcut connections that simply perform identity mappings

## Mask detection
We accomplished mask detection through transfer learning using Google's MobileNet.

#### Challenges
The challenges of mask detection through transfer learning are similar to those of face recognition. For accurate mask detection, we need to use a good quality camera with high resolution.

## Intelligent voice assistant
The intelligent voice assistant incorporated two types of chatbots;
  1. Speech Recognition
  2. Keyword chatbot
  3. AI chatbot
 
### Speech Recognition
The voice assistant used the python SpeechRecognition library to enable the machine to understand voice commands from the operator. It also uses the try and except functions to avoid unnecessary errors eg; UknownValueError which is caused by the program not understanding your statement and RequestError which happens when the internet is disconnected. Instead of the errors interrupting the program, the voice assistant will inform the operator ie;
  1. UknownValueError - I cant understand your statement
  2. RequestError - Your internet is disconnected

#### Challenge
The SpeechRecognition library is a bit slow and does not facilitate immediate responses. It takes a few seconds to understand a spoken statement; having to run the audio through google text to speech, whose effectiveness largely dependa on your internet speed.

#### Solution
The best way to use the SpeechRecognition library is by using your laptop's inbuilt microphone: if it is functional, otherwise use a good external device with a good microphone eg a usb microphone, usb camera with an inbuilt microphone, headphones or earphones equipped with a good microphone.
Make sure you have a reliable internet connection

### Keyword chatbot
The keyword chatbot used specific keywords to directly write data in TIA portal by using the Snap-7 library in python. This was mainly accomplished by using **if** statements. This enforces the security feature of the machine only if the authorized users are the only ones who have access to the keyworded commands. The snap-7 library writes and reads the required data in the TIA portal program by using the correct PLC addresses in the TIA portal program.

### AI chatbot
 The AI chatbot is mainly used to facilitate conversations about the machine processes with the operator. This was accomplished by first creating a dictionary file with all the possible questions or statements that the operator might use to ask about machine processes and the required answers. With this feature the machine will be able to train a new operator on all the processes that the machine can do. We incorporated natural language processing in creating the AI chatbot model by using nltk(natural language tool kit) and Tensorflow Keras API. The Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) is a platform used for building Python programs that work with human language data for applying in statistical natural language processing (NLP).It contains text processing libraries for tokenization, parsing, classification, stemming, tagging and semantic reasoning. 
 
# Communication with the PLC
So, you now have a voice assistant. You can communicate in natural language; you can have a general conversation with the assistant, you can specify the setpoint, you can tell the assistant to turn the chiller on, etc. How exactly does this happen? How does the assistant(written in python) communicate with the PLC, a device running on a completely different language?   

Recall from the tech stack summary, we said we use the snap7 library to interface python programs with the PLC. How does snap7 do this? Is it magic? Oh, does snap7 have other special abilities?  

Well, its not magic, and it certainly doesn't have 'special' abilities. The logic behind how it works lies in the memory of the PLC.  
## The memory of the PLC
If you have worked with PLCs, you're probably familiar with the tag table. if you have not, have no worries. We will go through what it is, and how it relates to the memory of a PLC. Below is a snap of the tag table for the analytic station.  

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83555928/118378804-eeb6be00-b58a-11eb-8327-bd261914cc81.png)  

All variables in a PLC program can be viewed from the tag table. Every variable has an associated data type and an address.   

Take the agitator motor for instance. The agitator motor is used for stirring acid,water and base in the mixing tank. It is connected to the output module of the PLC. The motor is either on or off. Therefore the associated data type is boolean(Bool). The address is %Q0.5, the 'Q' indicating an output.

If you look at the scaled PH input, the data type is real(floating point) and the address is %MD120. The 'M' stands for memory. The 'D' shows the position in memory where the data lies. 'D' indicates a double word(32 bit). In this PLC's memory, the scaled PH input is stored in the 32 bit position.  

All variables, excluding timers and counters, can be stored as inputs, outputs or memory within the memory of the PLC.  

When we work with PLCs, we access these memory locations, and either write to, or read from them.  

## The communication
To talk python to a PLC using the snap7 library, we need a python program that can find these memory locations, and then read or write to them using methods from util and types classes of the snap7 library.  
Luckily for us, Andrew Kibor has this python script on his github. This script(plc_utils.py) is at the top of this repository. The script has two functions; read_data and write_data. read_data takes two parametes; plc and the key (address tag). The function finds the location in memory of the tag and reads from it.  
write_data takes three parameters; the plc, the key to write to, and the value to write to that tag.

## The Virtual Simulation
We also added a virtual simulation feature to the project. This was achieved by mapping the signals from the input and output devices to the Simulation NX CAD design assembly using the PLC's inbuilt OPCUA server. The names of the mapped signals are defined in the PLC program, collected in the OPCUA python server code and then mapped in the MCD (Mechatronics Concept Designer) signals on NX CAD design.

### Thermal Process Control Simulation

The signals are collected from the PLC program and are fed into the server code then mapped into the NX design to show the status of the components and processes. To see the complete server code please check the server code in the Thermal Process Control Python Codes folder and open signal_server file.

In the Thermal Process Control project, we used Colour Coding method since there were no moving parts eg motors or rails. Specific colours were used to indicate whether some components were on and the type of process that is taking place ie water cooling or water heating. Consider the example below:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74649440/122030812-c2cf6800-cdd6-11eb-9ddb-82cece7fb29f.png)

This image indicates the Cooling process since:
  1. The Process Tank is blue in colour
  2. The Chiller is blue in colour which indicates it is on
  3. The Chiller heat exchanger is green in colour which indicates it is on
  4. The hot water tank, hot water heat exchanger and hotwater pump are orange in colour which indicates the heater is off and the three-way valve that controls the hot water      flow has been closed completely to prevent any rise in temperature.
  5. The Process Pump is green in colour which indicates that it is on.

This image below indicates the Heating Process

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74649440/122114465-fa1c3400-ce2b-11eb-8326-143c149697ca.png)

  1. The Process Tank is red in colour to indicate rise in temperature
  2. The Chiller and Chiller Heat Exchanger are orange in colour to indicate they are off.
  3. The Hot water tank is blue in colour to indicate that the heater is on.
  4. The hot water pump and hot water heat exchanger are green in colour to indicate that they are on and hot water is being pumped through the three-way valve.
  5. The Process Pump is green in colour which indicates that it is on.
