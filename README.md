# Task
Its 2020 and the world is in the fourth insustrial revolution!
Engineering Cyber-Physical systems are evolving from Digital Twin models to Digital Triplet.
At Dedan Kimathi University of Technology (DeKUT) SIEMENS Mechatronics Systems training centre, we are tasked to add Face-Recogniton security access and Voice assistants to the Digital Twin models of the Analytic and Thermal Process Control stations.
This repository outlines the approaches we took to achieve this

# Analytic and Thermal Process Control stations

Both of these stations are developed by Amatrol to teach and train on process control which is a vital part of of major industries, including: power generation; petrochemicals; food processing and bottling; chemical manufacturing; biotechnology; pharmaceuticals; and refineries.

The Analytic process control station monitors and regulates the PH of a process fluid. The station runs on PID Controller Module – Single Loop (T5554-C1-A) or PID Controller Module – Dual Loop (T5554-C2-A)

The Thermal process control station, on the other hand, regulates temperature. The controller for this station is PID Controller Module – Dual Loop (T5553-C2-A).

In 2018, the team of Isaiah Nassiuma, Emanuel Sunguti, Langat KIpkoech Rogers and Timothy KImari proposed a new control method based on the Siemens S7 1200 PLC PID control functionality.

In 2020, the controller used for both stations was the Siemens S7 1200 PLC (CPU 1214C DC/DC/DC)
